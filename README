This is a simple calculator program in C, mostly just for my own practice with GitHub and getting more comfortable with C and its quirks. 
It takes two integers and an operator (+, -, *, /, %) and performs the calculation. 
After each operation, it asks if I want to continue. It doesnâ€™t have safeguards (yet), so entering the wrong type of input or causing overflow might crash it. 
The goal here is mainly to experiment and learn, and possibly polish it in the future.

Requirements:
GNU Compiler (GCC) is required to compile this program.

Compile using:
gcc main.c - o main

Run using:
./main
